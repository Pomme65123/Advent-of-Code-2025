# Advent of Code 2025 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025), a series of programming puzzles released daily in December.

## Structure

Each day's solution is organized in its own folder:

### [Day 2: Invalid ID Validator](Day%202/README.md) 
Find and sum invalid IDs based on specific digit patterns.

### [Day 3: Battery Joltage Calculator](Day%203/README.md)
Find maximum joltage from battery banks by selecting optimal combinations.

### [Day 4: Paper Roll Accessibility Counter](Day%204/README.md)
Count accessible paper rolls in storage grids based on adjacency rules.

### [Day 5: Fresh Ingredient Detector](Day%205/README.md)
Determine ingredient freshness based on ID ranges and availability.

### [Day 6: Vertical Math Expression Evaluator](Day%206/README.md)
Evaluate mathematical expressions written vertically in character grids.

## General Setup

### Input File Requirements
**Important**: Each solution expects its input data to be named `input.txt` and placed in the respective day's folder. Make sure to:
1. Download your personal input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025)
2. Save it as `input.txt` in the corresponding day folder
3. Input files are personal to each participant and are excluded from version control

### Running Solutions
1. Navigate to the specific day's folder
2. Ensure your puzzle input is saved as `input.txt`
3. Compile the source file (e.g., `javac mainPartOne.java` or `javac mainPartTwo.java`)
4. Run the compiled program (e.g., `java mainPartOne` or `java mainPartTwo`)
